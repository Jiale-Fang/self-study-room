Oracle has a poor record for making it easy to install and configure Java, 
but using Homebrew, the latest OpenJDK (Java 14) can be installed with:

brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8

For the many use cases depending on an older version (commonly Java 8), 
the AdoptOpenJDK project makes it possible with an extra step.

brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk

brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8
