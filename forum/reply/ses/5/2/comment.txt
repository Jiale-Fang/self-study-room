So let's do some testing together. 
Firstly can we clean this up to nest the ajax calls? 
Then can you add in some console.
log statements to find out what each is sending back? 
If you miss some output we know where it's going wrong and that'll help us fix things.

Note I've changed success to the 'done' additions 
because success is a bit out of date, and everything is nested to eliminate the question 
around whether any blanks are being sent in to the next calls (synchronicity issues):
