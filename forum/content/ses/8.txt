I've just started writing my first JavaFX 2 application after learning the basics and would like to internationalize it.

I notice that in JavaFX 1.x, the scripting language allowed for very simple internationalization of strings. Are there any similar features in JavaFX 2?

Basically: what is the best practice for internationalizing a JavaFX 2 application?
