I have a very big program that is currently using SWT. 
The program can be run on both Windows, Mac and Linux, and it is a big desktop application with many elements. 
Now SWT being somewhat old I would like to switch to either Swing or JavaFX. And I would like to hear your thoughts on three things.

My main concern is what will be better for a desktop GUI application?
 (I looked online and a lot of people suggest that JavaFX is just as good as Swing, 
but I didn't see many valid arguments except simple opinion flame wars). 
It has to work on both Windows, Mac and some popular Linux distributions.
